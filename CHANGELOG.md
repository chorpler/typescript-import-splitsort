### 1.0.4

Fixed problem with extension activating for non-TypeScript files

### 1.0.1

After eating my own dog food for a while, it became clear that a case-insensitive sort is a Really Bad Idea! Lowercase exports are semantically different to uppercase exports: the former are typically functions and the latter classes. The two are now separated [#1](https://github.com/mflorence99/typescript-import-splitsort/issues/1).

### 1.0.0

Initial release.
